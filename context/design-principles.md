# Actionable UI/UX Design Plan

This document provides a structured, actionable plan for designing user-centric, effective, and accessible websites. Follow these phases and steps to ensure a principled approach to every project.

## Phase 1: Strategy & Foundation

This phase focuses on establishing a solid blueprint based on user needs and business goals.

### Step 1.1: Define Goals and Understand Users
- [ ] **Define Business Goals:** Clearly articulate the primary objectives of the website.  
- [ ] **Conduct User Research:** Identify the target audience. Use interviews, surveys, and personas to understand their needs, goals, and mental models.  

### Step 1.2: Content Inventory and Audit
- [ ] **Catalog All Content:** Create a comprehensive list of all existing content (pages, images, documents, etc.).  
- [ ] **Audit Content:** Evaluate content for relevance, accuracy, and necessity. Decide what to keep, revise, or remove.  

### Step 1.3: Establish the Information Architecture (IA)
- [ ] **Conduct Card Sorting:** Use card sorting exercises with target users to understand how they group information. This will form the basis of an intuitive IA.  
- [ ] **Choose an Organization Structure:** Based on user feedback and content type, select a primary structure:  
  - **Hierarchical:** For complex sites with clear categories and subcategories.  
  - **Sequential:** For process-driven flows like checkouts or tutorials.  
  - **Matrix:** For content that needs to be sorted and filtered by multiple attributes (e.g., e-commerce).  
- [ ] **Develop a Clear Labeling System:** Use clear, consistent, and user-understood terminology for all navigation, links, and headings. Avoid jargon.  
- [ ] **Create a Sitemap and User Flows:** Visualize the structure and map out the key paths users will take through the site.

## Phase 2: Layout & Interaction Design

This phase applies core design and psychological principles to create an intuitive and efficient user experience.

### Step 2.1: Adopt a Mobile-First & Responsive Framework
- [ ] **Design for Mobile First:** Start the design process with the smallest screen. This forces prioritization of essential content and functionality.  
- [ ] **Use a Fluid Grid:** Define layout widths using relative units (percentages, fr) instead of fixed pixels to ensure the layout adapts smoothly.  
- [ ] **Implement Flexible Images:** Ensure images scale within their containers by using `max-width: 100%`.  
- [ ] **Use CSS Media Queries:** Apply different styles at specific breakpoints to optimize the layout for various screen sizes.  
- [ ] **Follow Progressive Enhancement:** Build the site in layers (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to ensure a baseline experience is available to all users, regardless of browser or device capabilities.  

### Step 2.2: Establish a Clear Visual Hierarchy
- [ ] **Define Three Levels of Dominance:**  
  - **Dominant:** The single most important element (e.g., main headline, primary CTA).  
  - **Sub-dominant:** Elements of secondary importance (e.g., subheadings).  
  - **Subordinate:** The main body of text and supplementary information.  
- [ ] **Use Visual Cues to Guide Attention:**  
  - **Size & Scale:** Larger elements are perceived as more important.  
  - **Color & Contrast:** Bright, high-contrast elements draw the eye.  
  - **White Space:** Isolate important elements with negative space to increase their prominence.  
- [ ] **Design for Scanning Patterns:**  
  - **F-Pattern:** For text-heavy pages, place key information along the top and left side.  
  - **Z-Pattern:** For less dense pages, place key elements at the corners of the "Z".  

### Step 2.3: Apply Fundamental Laws of UX
- [ ] **Hick's Law (Simplify Choices):** Reduce cognitive load by limiting options. Keep primary navigation to 5–7 items.  
- [ ] **Fitts's Law (Target Size):** Make interactive elements large enough to be easily clicked, especially on touchscreens (minimum 44x44px).  
- [ ] **Jakob's Law (Familiarity):** Use conventional design patterns for common UI elements.  
- [ ] **Miller's Law (Chunking):** Group related information into smaller, manageable chunks.  
- [ ] **Gestalt Principles (Visual Perception):** Use proximity, similarity, and grouping to create a logical and organized interface.

## Phase 3: Component-Level Design

This phase focuses on the fine details of individual UI components.

### Step 3.1: Design Intuitive Navigation
- [ ] **Be Simple, Clear, and Consistent:** Navigation should be predictable and appear in the same location on every page.  
- [ ] **Indicate Current Location:** Use a visual cue (e.g., color change, bold text) to show the user which page they are on.  
- [ ] **Provide Multiple Navigation Paths:** Include primary navigation, search, breadcrumbs, and a sitemap in the footer.  

### Step 3.2: Craft Legible and Readable Typography
- [ ] **Set a Comfortable Body Font Size:** Minimum effective size of 16px for body text.  
- [ ] **Optimize Line Length:** 45–90 characters per line on desktop, 30–50 on mobile.  
- [ ] **Set Appropriate Line Height:** About 1.5× font size for body text; 1.1–1.3× for headings.  
- [ ] **Pair Fonts Effectively:**  
  - Limit to 2–3 fonts.  
  - Choose contrasting but complementary fonts (e.g., serif + sans-serif).  
  - Assign clear roles (headings vs body).  

### Step 3.3: Use Color and Contrast Accessibly
- [ ] **Meet WCAG Contrast Ratios:**  
  - **AA Standard:** 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text.  
- [ ] **Do Not Rely on Color Alone:** Use icons, text labels, or underlines for links and error states.  

### Step 3.4: Design Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs)
- [ ] **Use Action-Oriented Language:** Keep concise (2–5 words).  
- [ ] **Make CTAs Visually Prominent:** Use a contrasting color and white space.  
- [ ] **Establish a CTA Hierarchy:** Single dominant primary CTA; secondary actions should be visually subordinate.  

### Step 3.5: Implement Meaningful Interaction Design
- [ ] **Ensure Clear Affordances and Signifiers:** Elements should visually suggest their use.  
- [ ] **Provide Immediate Feedback:** Every action should show a confirmation/result.  
- [ ] **Use Functional Microinteractions:** Implement purposeful animations with Trigger, Rules, and Feedback.

## Phase 4: Accessibility & Testing

This phase ensures the final product is inclusive and validated with real users.

### Step 4.1: Adhere to Universal Design & WCAG
- [ ] **Follow the Four POUR Principles:**  
  - **Perceivable:** Provide text alternatives for images and captions for videos.  
  - **Operable:** All functionality must be accessible via keyboard.  
  - **Understandable:** Use clear language and predictable interfaces.  
  - **Robust:** Use valid HTML and ARIA roles for assistive technologies.  
- [ ] **Use Semantic HTML:** Use proper tags (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<h1>`–`<h6>`, `<button>`) for accessibility.  

### Step 4.2: Test Continuously and Iteratively
- [ ] **Test on Real Devices:** Validate across multiple real mobile and desktop devices.  
- [ ] **Conduct Usability Testing:** Test with real users, including those with disabilities.  
- [ ] **Use Automated Tools:** Regularly run accessibility and contrast checkers.
